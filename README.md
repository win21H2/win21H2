ðŸ‘‹Hi there, I go by the screen name 324Hz and any code that I develop goes under that name so refer to me as 324Hz not win_21H2 :)

Frontend dev for my own website learning backend stuff <br>

"haha NO" - 324Hz/win21H2

Some things I am currently working on:

- Project Silent Willow: <br>
// Image recognition w/ Jupyter labs and Nvidia Jetson nanos <br>
// LiDAR mapping w/ ROS/RPLiDAR and Nvidia Jetson nanos <br>
// Serial communications via USB (<b> Nvidia Jetson nanos to Arduino boards </b>) <br>
// ESP32 communications with Heroku and Project Silent Willow <br>
// Controling stepper motors with ESP32's and a Bluetooth Terminal application

The two Jetsons that I used with my projects below :) <br>
